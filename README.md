# 3D Engine V2
## Brief
This is the second 3D Engine I am developing, in this one I take the lessons and concepts that I've learned from my
previous experience and incorporate them as much as I can here.

The main reason why I am developing a new 3D Engine is because a lot of the old architechture and thoughts got in the way
of new things and I was very hindered with how I was developing.

It got more and more difficult to add a new thing to render and connecting the dots started to take too much time.
Some of the things I did at the start still live in the code and things I did two years later as well.

While there are some great concepts (imo) in my previous engine, there were a lot of bad ones as well, so instead of fighting against them
I'll start from a fresh slate.
